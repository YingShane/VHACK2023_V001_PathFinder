          You are energized by challenge and are often inspired by a problem that others perceive as impossible to solve.

          You are a master of re-inventing the wheel and often refuse to do a task the same way twice. You question norms and often ignore them altogether. Established procedures are uninspiring to the you, as you would much rather try a new method (or two) than go along with the standard. You are confident in your ability to think creatively, and may assume that others are too tied to tradition to see a new way.
