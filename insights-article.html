          Hello, students! My name is Dohn Joe, and I am a software engineer at Xortiv Sdn. Bhd., I am often asked by secondary school students what my job actually entails. 
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          I have noticed that many students are unsure of what a software engineer does, and it is understandable considering that software engineering is a relatively new field that has emerged in the last few decades. However, it is essential for students to be aware of what a software engineer does as it is a highly lucrative and rewarding career path that offers a wide range of opportunities. 
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          In this article, I aim to demystify software engineering and explain what software engineers do, why it is a great career path, and how students can prepare themselves for a career in this field.

          Software engineering is like building a house. Just like a house has a foundation, walls, and a roof, software also has a structure. However, unlike building a house, software engineering is an iterative process that involves continual refinement and improvement. Software engineers use engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software solutions that meet the needs of users and businesses.
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          One of the key differences between software engineering and other forms of engineering is that software engineering is an iterative process. This means that software engineers continually refine and improve the software they develop through multiple stages of development, including planning, designing, coding, testing, and maintenance.
