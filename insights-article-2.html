          What Does a Surgeon Do?
          <br/>
          
          </span>
          <span class="LHN-sub-2">
          A surgeon is a medical professional who specializes in performing surgical procedures on patients to diagnose, treat, and manage various medical conditions. Surgeons operate on the human body to repair or remove damaged tissues, organs, or structures. They use various surgical tools and techniques to achieve their goals.
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          Surgeons work in hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities. They work closely with other medical professionals, including anesthesiologists, nurses, and other surgical team members, to ensure that patients receive the best possible care.

          <span class="LHN-sub-4">
          Surgery is a broad field that includes many different specialties. Some of the most common surgical specialties include:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          General surgery: This specialty involves performing a wide range of surgical procedures, including abdominal surgery, breast surgery, and skin surgery.
          <br/><br/>
          Orthopedic surgery: This specialty focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and conditions.
          <br/><br/>
          Neurosurgery: This specialty involves operating on the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
          <br/><br/>
          Cardiothoracic surgery: This specialty focuses on the surgical treatment of heart and lung conditions.
          <br/><br/>
          Plastic surgery: This specialty involves performing surgical procedures to improve the appearance of the face and body.

          The Surgical Process
          <br/>
          
          </span>
          <span class="LHN-sub-6">
          Before a surgical procedure can take place, the surgeon and the patient will meet to discuss the details of the surgery, including the risks and benefits. The patient will also undergo a pre-operative evaluation to ensure that they are healthy enough to undergo surgery.
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          During the surgery, the patient will be given anesthesia to prevent them from feeling any pain. The surgeon will make incisions in the skin and use surgical tools to perform the procedure. Once the surgery is complete, the patient will be moved to a recovery room where they will be monitored closely.
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          After the surgery, the patient will receive post-operative care to help them recover. This may include pain management, wound care, and physical therapy.

          <span class="LHN-sub-8">
          Contrary to popular belief, being a surgeon is not all about blood, guts, and gore. While surgical procedures can be intense and complex, surgeons are highly trained professionals who take great care to ensure that their patients are safe and comfortable throughout the process.
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          Surgeons also have a great deal of responsibility. They must be able to make quick decisions and take action to save their patients&#39; lives in emergency situations. This requires a high level of skill, knowledge, and experience.
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          In addition, surgeons must be able to communicate effectively with their patients and their colleagues. They must be able to explain complex medical concepts in terms that are easy for patients to understand, and they must be able to work well with other members of the surgical team.

          <span class="LHN-sub-10">
          Becoming a surgeon requires a significant amount of education and training. To become a surgeon, you must first complete a four-year undergraduate degree in a related field, such as biology, chemistry, or pre-med.
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          After completing your undergraduate degree, you must attend medical school, which typically takes four years. During medical school, you will learn about human anatomy, physiology, and medical ethics.
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          After completing medical school, you must complete a residency program, which can last anywhere from three to seven years, depending on your specialty. During your residency, you will receive hands-on training in your specialty under the guidance of experienced surgeons.
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          After completing your residency, you may choose to complete a fellowship, which is additional training in a specialized area of surgery.
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          Becoming a surgeon is a challenging and rewarding career path that requires a high level of education, training, and dedication. While surgical procedures can be intense and complex, surgeons are highly trained professionals who take great care to ensure that their patients are safe and comfortable throughout the process.

          If you are considering a career as a surgeon, it is important to understand the realities of the job. While the path to becoming a surgeon may be long and challenging, the rewards can be significant. You will have the opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of your patients and contribute to the field of medicine in a meaningful way.
